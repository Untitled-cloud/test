GPT-4o Mini
Hello, how can I help you today?
Respond in the English language.You are a YouTube video analysis assistant. Your task is to summarize the content of the video and generate a summary includes highlights with key moments and topics discussed in the video. Follow these steps to execute the task:

1. Analyze the video content:
   Review the video content provided in the webpage. Identify the main themes, topics, and key moments that are discussed throughout the video.
  2. Create a summary:
   Write a concise summary of the video, capturing the essence of the content in 3-5 sentences. Focus on the main points and any significant conclusions drawn in the video.

3. Identify highlights:
   List key moments in the video that are particularly noteworthy as a list in the table. For each highlight, give the timestamp second first and next to it provide a brief description of what happens in that timestamp second and why it is significant. Do not change the second format or value, Do NOT convert to seconds to hours format, just give it as second. Aim for 5-10 highlights.

4. Format the response:
   Organize the summary and highlights into a visually appealing sidebar format. Include headings for 'Summary' and 'Highlights', and ensure that the highlights are easy to read and navigate.

5. Output the results:
   Present the summary and highlights in a clear and structured manner, ready to be displayed next to the video.

Notes:
- Ensure that the summary is informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to watch the video.
- The highlights should be specific and provide enough context for viewers to understand the significance of each moment.
- Avoid including any personal opinions or unnecessary commentary; focus solely on the content of the video.

Video content: second:0 text:I did a poll the day before,
second:2 text:and about 1500 people took part in the poll.
second:3 text:The main thing is
second:5 text:to count which openwrt
second:6 text:firmware you usually use.
second:8 text:The voting results show
second:9 text:that the highest proportion is iStoreOS,
second:10 text:which has exceeded 50%.
second:13 text:The second most popular is ImmortalWrt
second:15 text:which accounts for more than 20 percent
second:16 text:I have put the specific screenshots here.
second:18 text:Of course
second:21 text:there are at most five options in the voting of YouTube
second:24 text:so later I launched a vote in Station B and put more than a dozen options
second:25 text:I have also put the screenshot here
second:26 text:From this result,
second:28 text:you can see that the popularity of
second:29 text:a firmware may not depend entirely
second:31 text:on whether the technology is hard-core or not.
second:33 text:Is this repository
second:35 text:up to date,
second:37 text:using the most popular plug-ins?
second:38 text:It depends on a novice&#39;s user experience when using the firmware for the first time.
second:41 text:Commonly known as the threshold
second:42 text:the lower the threshold
second:44 text:the higher the frequency of firmware use
second:45 text:But then again
second:47 text:although iStoreOS accounts for the highest proportion
second:49 text:it can not fully meet the needs of all people
second:53 text:That&#39;s what I said.
second:54 text:Sometimes a function that you
second:56 text:think is
second:56 text:very powerful may not be worth mentioning to others.
second:57 text:Sometimes a feature you sniff
second:59 text:at may seem
second:60 text:essential to others.
second:61 text:If you understand the above two sentences,
second:63 text:then congratulations! ~, you are a middle-aged man.
second:66 text:So how can we reconcile this contradiction?
second:68 text:Today
second:69 text:for a change
second:71 text:we will introduce other OpenWrt three minutes to customize their own firmware
second:73 text:And reduce the threshold of first use as much as possible
second:76 text:In addition to the firmware itself
second:77 text:I will also talk about the idea of expansion and backup
second:80 text:The video is quite long
second:81 text:I hope you like it and collect it
second:84 text:So you can see that the firmware that I&#39;m running right now is ImmortalWrt, which we&#39;re going to talk about today
second:88 text:You can see that this firmware is very pure
second:91 text:and there are no miscellaneous functions
second:94 text:But some of the plug-ins are already integrated
second:96 text:right
second:100 text:And then under this system package
second:102 text:you can see that the current package is 2GB of free space
second:106 text:So it is convenient for us to install some other software later
second:109 text:So how is such a firmware built?
second:111 text:Today we will talk about this topic.
second:112 text:Yes, I think
second:114 text:you have already thought that
second:115 text:if you want to build quickly,
second:116 text:you will undoubtedly use imagebuilder to build
second:118 text:in the cloud.
second:118 text:This speed is the fastest.
second:119 text:You can see that this
second:121 text:is an online platform built
second:122 text:by the original openwrt official
second:124 text:website.
second:124 text:Through the drop-down options on the right,
second:126 text:we can select the version of luci,
second:128 text:and then here we can select some models you want.
second:130 text:Just search by yourself, for example,
second:132 text:r2s,
second:134 text:right? You can find this kind of model,
second:135 text:a platform like this.
second:137 text:In fact, I found two or three,
second:138 text:this is official,
second:140 text:and then this kwrtkwrt is a website
second:142 text:that has been established for two years.
second:145 text:And it has many subdivisions and many functions.
second:148 text:What we introduce today is very similar to the official website,
second:152 text:but it is also free.
second:153 text:At the same time,
second:155 text:it contains the third-party software packages we want,
second:156 text:so we focus
second:157 text:on how we should build it.
second:159 text:Especially how these parameters should be written.
second:161 text:After opening this interface,
second:162 text:you can see that there is
second:165 text:a customization here.
second:166 text:You can see that there is a pre-installed package
second:168 text:and a script for the first run.
second:170 text:I have put the text tutorial accompanying
second:172 text:today&#39;s video in the description area below the video,
second:174 text:and it may also be placed at the top of the comments.
second:176 text:You can watch it together according to the pictures and videos.
second:179 text:Of course, I have saved a copy
second:181 text:of the firmware compiled today to my Google Internet disk
second:184 text:and put it here.
second:185 text:Then last time I voted,
second:188 text:I also saw a message that he asked me to help make a firmware
second:191 text:for R1S,
second:193 text:because I saw his message.So I also made a network disk for me by the way, that is,
second:195 text:R1S has been put here,
second:197 text:including the information of the software has been written.
second:200 text:If this little friend needs to see my video
second:201 text:you can download it by yourself
second:204 text:It&#39;s like this by default
second:206 text:After clicking on the custom expansion,
second:209 text:we can fill in some third-party applications,
second:211 text:such as science plug-ins.You can write it in here.
second:215 text:There must be a standard for what software
second:217 text:we have and what software we don&#39;t have. We can&#39;t write it casually.
second:220 text:This involves a warehouse.
second:222 text:Click on my blog,
second:223 text:and this is the address of the warehouse.
second:225 text:As you can see, this is some of the warehouse addresses
second:228 text:of Tianling&#39;s firmware,
second:230 text:and this is where all the APPs are.
second:232 text:Suppose we want to confirm whether there is a plug-in.
second:238 text:For example,
second:239 text:if you search for PW, you can see that it has been found,
second:241 text:which means that the warehouse has this plug-in.
second:243 text:We can search for another oc
second:248 text:no problem
second:250 text:Yes, there is. No problem.
second:255 text:Ssrp indicates that there is no ssrp in this repository
second:259 text:but to be honest
second:261 text:the three plug-ins just inserted are enough for us to use
second:262 text:And especially PW
second:264 text:they have a lot of common places
second:266 text:and there is no need to install both
second:267 text:Here I give you a summary of some commonly used plug-ins
second:270 text:this plug-in is for the Chinese firewall
second:273 text:Because it may be in English by default
second:275 text:this plug-in is meant to add a file manager
second:276 text:In particular
second:278 text:we need to upload and download
second:280 text:which I think is necessary and can&#39;t be streamlined any more
second:282 text:Then this is a purple theme
second:285 text:which will make it look better
second:287 text:Then this is also necessary
second:289 text:for the localization of the software package.
second:291 text:Then this is a terminal
second:293 text:which is convenient for us to enter the code in the web page
second:295 text:Then there are several famous science plug-ins
second:298 text:one is PW
second:300 text:the other is oc
second:301 text:and there is a feature of Tianling firmware HP is
second:304 text:good  These are the plug-ins that I
second:307 text:think are more important.
second:308 text:If it&#39;s you, you can add them here. It doesn&#39;t matter.
second:311 text:If your needs are the same as mine, in fact,
second:313 text:you can just download the firmware I compiled.
second:316 text:Or you can click here to copy it and then we
second:319 text:can paste it directly here.
second:322 text:Pay attention to the problem of some spaces.
second:324 text:The key point is that I
second:326 text:want to focus on the following script,
second:327 text:which I just mentioned at the beginning of the film.
second:329 text:We try to lower the threshold of the first use,
second:332 text:so the script of UCI is very critical.
second:335 text:Let me explain why I write this separately.
second:338 text:The function of this is to open the firewall of
second:341 text:the Wan port for the convenience of
second:342 text:virtual machine users,
second:343 text:which is very critical.Direct access with the Wan port is equivalent to a physical machine,
second:345 text:which can be done with a network cable.
second:348 text:Of course, if you feel unsafe,
second:350 text:you can turn it off later.
second:352 text:Ok, what does the second sentence mean?
second:354 text:I set up a host name mapping.
second:356 text:This problem is to solve
second:357 text:the problem that our vast number of TV box enthusiasts,
second:359 text:especially Android native TV, can not connect to the Internet for the first time.
second:363 text:I have built this in
second:364 text:so you don&#39;t need to set it manually
second:366 text:What is the third point
second:367 text:I match the Internet access mode according to the number of network cards
second:372 text:If you have a single network port now
second:375 text:I will set it to DHCP mode
second:378 text:If you don&#39;t understand,
second:380 text:you can think of soft routing as
second:382 text:a NAS.  If there is only one network port
second:383 text:you have to let it access the Internet
second:385 text:so it will be convenient for us to connect to the Internet
second:387 text:If you want to set up bypass routes later
second:388 text:it is also very convenient
second:390 text:because it is very convenient to have a network
second:392 text:If there are multiple network ports,
second:396 text:for example, two or more network ports,
second:399 text:the default setting is static IP.Then the Wan port firewall is still open.
second:401 text:My modifications have been written in the instructions of the firmware
second:403 text:that is to say
second:405 text:I have done a few jobs in total
second:408 text:The first is to change the IP address
second:411 text:from 1.1 to 100.1,
second:413 text:because 1.1 may conflict with the optical cat.
second:415 text:The Wan port firewall is opened to facilitate web access
second:417 text:Then the second point is to add custom domain name hijacking
second:420 text:and set this theme.
second:421 text:The third point is to install these four plug-ins in the service.
second:425 text:We will talk about it later. We will talk about an expansion operation.
second:427 text:The last point is to determine its Internet access mode according to the number of network ports.
second:432 text:If you understand all this
second:434 text:you can copy it down
second:437 text:click copy and paste it directly
second:440 text:If we are sure that there are no problems
second:443 text:we can just click on the request to build
second:446 text:and then we can download it in three minutes
second:448 text:Then it will show that the build request has been received
second:452 text:If there is an error in these two lines of parameters
second:455 text:it will report an error
second:456 text:So try not to make mistakes
second:458 text:And the button of this request building
second:460 text:should not be triggered frequently,
second:462 text:and it should not be triggered twice in a minute.
second:464 text:This process may last for about three minutes,
second:466 text:so you can wait patiently.
second:468 text:When it is built,
second:469 text:there will be a download address for the image.
second:471 text:Well, after a few minutes,
second:473 text:it will show that the build is successful.
second:475 text:There is a custom download at the bottom,
second:477 text:and there are so many image formats.
second:479 text:I strongly recommend that
second:481 text:you download this format,
second:483 text:combineEFI, because this EFI is
second:484 text:compatible with the traditional BIOS and can be
second:486 text:backward compatible.
second:488 text:There is also a read-only partition in it.
second:490 text:In the future
second:492 text:if you want to restore or reset the system
second:493 text:it will be very convenient
second:496 text:Its size is more than 50 megabytes,
second:498 text:which is very small, and after decompression,
second:500 text:it is more than 300 megabytes.
second:501 text:When we open this software package,
second:504 text:we will find that its remaining space may only be 200 megabytes.
second:505 text:How to say this 200 megabytes?
second:506 text:If you don&#39;t use docker
second:508 text:this 200 megabytes is absolutely enough
second:509 text:but if you want to use docker later
second:512 text:This 200 megabytes is absolutely not enough
second:513 text:This involves the problem of expanding the capacity of firmware.
second:516 text:There are two ways to expand the capacity
second:517 text:one is to directly deal with the firmware itself
second:519 text:and the other is to expand the capacity after the system is running
second:522 text:Let&#39;s talk about the difference between these two expansion methods.
second:525 text:In fact, there are only two points,
second:526 text:one is the difference of reset,
second:527 text:and the other is the difference of upgrade.
second:528 text:First of all, let&#39;s talk about the difference of reset.
second:530 text:If the firmware itself is expanded,
second:533 text:then it is still the size after reset.
second:535 text:For example,
second:537 text:if you expand to 2GB before, it will still be 2GB after resetting,
second:539 text:because the firmware itself is 2GB.
second:540 text:If the capacity is expanded after operation
second:542 text:the size after reset must be the size before expansion
second:545 text:The second method has certain disadvantages
second:547 text:which is not conducive to reset
second:548 text:Let&#39;s talk about the difference of upgrading again. In fact, there is no difference in upgrading, because the essence of upgrading is to change a firmware.So after the upgrade, it&#39;s the size
second:549 text:of the new firmware.
second:551 text:The new firmware is
second:553 text:as big as it is.
second:555 text:For example,
second:557 text:the new firmware
second:558 text:is 200 megabytes.
second:560 text:So it&#39;s 200 megabytes. The new firmware is 300 megabytes. That&#39;s 300 megabytes.
second:562 text:Considering that the upgrade is not a high-frequency operation,
second:564 text:the firmware may not be replaced for a year and a half
second:566 text:after it is stable.
second:568 text:And this reset is more important.
second:570 text:If you encounter any network problems,
second:573 text:you will be fine after resetting, and you don&#39;t need to delve into what caused it.
second:575 text:In short, the general reset is good.
second:577 text:So I personally prefer to use the first method to expand capacity.
second:581 text:The second method is actually simpler
second:583 text:because now Pd has developed a third-party plug-in for us
second:584 text:Partition is very easy
second:587 text:you can partition directly with one click
second:589 text:Next, we will talk about these two methods separately.
second:595 text:All right
second:598 text:let&#39;s take a look at that firmware we just built and download
second:600 text:I
second:601 text:suggest that you use the iStoreOS environment
second:605 text:directly as a processing tool. In fact,
second:606 text:other openwrt or other Linux can also be used.
second:608 text:But considering that other openwrts may not have that much space to deal with,
second:610 text:Because at least you have to make
second:612 text:sure that your space is
second:615 text:more than 2GB.
second:616 text:Many openwrts don&#39;t actually have such a large partition, so it&#39;s not easy to
second:619 text:handle.
second:621 text:If your openwrt
second:622 text:does have such a large partition,
second:624 text:you have to install these two additional components.
second:627 text:So I won&#39;t show you this. I&#39;ll use
second:628 text:iStoreOS to do the demonstration.
second:631 text:Suppose this is an iStoreOS that has been refreshed.
second:634 text:If you don&#39;t have iStoreOS,
second:635 text:You can use a USB stick to install
second:637 text:one on another machine,
second:639 text:or install one in a virtual machine.
second:641 text:Then we open the file manager and click
second:643 text:here to upload.
second:646 text:Okay, this is the firmware we just downloaded.
second:648 text:Let&#39;s change the name first.
second:650 text:The name is a little long.
second:652 text:ImmortalWrt. IMG.
second:655 text:GZ we upload it directly.
second:658 text:
second:660 text:Upload the click terminal,
second:663 text:Next, we will CD to the directory just now.
second:670 text:Okay, this is what we just uploaded.
second:672 text:Okay, we can do the next operation by comparing this blog.
second:675 text:First of all, the first step is
second:677 text:to decompress the image,
second:679 text:decompress it into MG, and then do some filling data for the image.Of course,
second:683 text:these two steps can actually be combined into one,
second:685 text:so let&#39;s just copy it and right click
second:687 text:to paste it.
second:690 text:Ok
second:692 text:now he is unzipping
second:694 text:gzip-kd means that the original file is still there after unzipping
second:696 text:and it has been filled
second:698 text:After the population is complete,
second:698 text:we then actually assign 2GB of
second:703 text:space to the partition because it
second:705 text:is now in a mounted state.
second:708 text:Without actually assigning the partition step, just use the parted command.
second:713 text:Now you
second:714 text:can see that you have entered the command line status
second:717 text:of the parted partition tool.
second:719 text:Enter print and it will have such a prompt.
second:723 text:If this prompt appears,
second:724 text:you must enter OK,
second:726 text:capitalized OK, and then there will be
second:729 text:a warning here.
second:731 text:Don&#39;t worry about it or type fix,
second:733 text:just fix and enter.
second:737 text:
second:737 text:In this case
second:738 text:you can see a partition structure of this image
second:740 text:You can see that the image is so big by default
second:743 text:and the total space is more than 300 megabytes
second:746 text:So we do a filling on this basis.
second:748 text:resizepart2100%
second:750 text:This 2 represents the expansion from the second partition to 100 percent
second:754 text:Okay
second:754 text:let&#39;s enter resizepart2100% here
second:757 text:In this way, 2GB of
second:759 text:empty data will be completely filled
second:761 text:into the real partition.
second:763 text:Then press Enter Then we&#39;ll print it again at this time.
second:768 text:Ok, you can see that
second:770 text:this time its space has become 2412 megabytes,
second:774 text:which was 315 megabytes before,
second:776 text:which means that we have successfully expanded our capacity.
second:778 text:Then we type quit, and that&#39;s it.
second:782 text:So what you see now is after the image processing
second:787 text:This is before
second:789 text:Don&#39;t confuse it.Let&#39;s delete the previous one first
second:793 text:This is after processing
second:795 text:and we can download it directly
second:797 text:If you want to compress further,
second:799 text:you just type gzip -k,
second:800 text:and then the image name
second:803 text:is compressed further.
second:805 text:After compression, it is very small,
second:806 text:that is, more than 50 megabytes.
second:808 text:All right, this side has been compressed.
second:810 text:After the compression,
second:812 text:we will refresh the final expansion.
second:814 text:This is before compression,
second:816 text:and this is after compression.
second:818 text:If you put
second:819 text:it on the network disk,
second:821 text:you will use the small one,
second:823 text:and then I have put the expanded files on
second:825 text:my Google network disk.
second:827 text:Specifically in this position, you can see that there is a 2GBOPKG on the name,
second:830 text:which represents the expansion.
second:832 text:Next
second:836 text:we will show it to you on this machine
second:837 text:Ok
second:838 text:now you see the firmware that we just expanded
second:840 text:I have already refreshed the machine
second:842 text:and then just click on the login
second:843 text:Because there is no password by default
second:845 text:After logging in
second:847 text:let&#39;s take a look at the system and click on the software package
second:849 text:You can see that the remaining space is 2.1GB
second:852 text:Because the firmware itself is expanded
second:855 text:So if you want to reset in the future
second:858 text:if you click Reset here
second:859 text:the size of the package will not change
second:864 text:Okay, I&#39;m going to talk about the second method.
second:866 text:The second method is to install a partition expansion software
second:870 text:directly in the running state.
second:873 text:This tool is a plug-in made
second:876 text:by sirpdboy.
second:877 text:So we wrote a one-click installation script
second:880 text:based on the above ipk,
second:883 text:and then we actually copied this line.
second:886 text:If your firmware doesn&#39;t have a terminal,
second:888 text:you can also use
second:890 text:finalshell or other tools.
second:892 text:All right, just paste it here and enter.
second:901 text:Ok, after the installation is successful, there will be a prompt here.
second:904 text:If the installation is successful,
second:906 text:you can log out and log in again.
second:908 text:Then click on the system
second:910 text:this time there is an extra partition Capacity expansion
second:915 text:So this tool is very simple.
second:916 text:If you want to back up some of your current software
second:920 text:we&#39;ll check Keep Configuration
second:924 text:Then here is the space for expanding your opkg
second:927 text:which is commonly known as the space for software packages
second:929 text:And then this target hard disk,
second:934 text:the hard disk that you&#39;re using right now,And then it will allocate the remaining space to the package,
second:937 text:so this way is not very flexible,
second:940 text:you can not specify the size of it.
second:942 text:Of course,
second:944 text:if you have other hard disks,
second:945 text:for example, I have other hard disks,
second:949 text:you can also expand them to other hard disk space.Then click Execute  Let&#39;s take a look at the log.
second:953 text:It&#39;s being tested now
second:956 text:Building partition
second:957 text:It will be restarted after successful execution
second:959 text:There will be a log here.
second:961 text:It&#39;s starting to back up now. Okay, now it&#39;s backed
second:963 text:up successfully.
second:967 text:The device is about to restart, OK?
second:969 text:It&#39;s restarting now. Let&#39;s wait a moment.
second:970 text:Well,
second:972 text:after a while, it has restarted.
second:974 text:After restarting
second:974 text:we click on the system
second:979 text:click on this package
second:981 text:and you can see that the space of this package becomes 54.39 in an instant
second:984 text:This space is exactly the remaining space of my hard disk
second:988 text:so we have successfully expanded the capacity
second:990 text:We can see that there is still partition expansion under the left system
second:993 text:What does this mean
second:994 text:This shows that the backup just now is effective,
second:997 text:because our partition expansion is equivalent to third-party software.
second:1001 text:But when you reboot, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s still there.
second:1003 text:These are the two expansion methods I talked about.
second:1008 text:Next
second:1010 text:let&#39;s talk about backup
second:1012 text:If you want to brush the firmware of my Google Internet Disk after watching my video today
second:1014 text:Before this upgrade
second:1015 text:I suggest you make a backup
second:1017 text:Of course, the upgrade can generally retain the configuration,
second:1020 text:but it is best to make a backup.  Just in case,
second:1022 text:my advice to everyone is to do a backup first,
second:1025 text:then upgrade, and then restore.
second:1028 text:In this case, all the software you installed before should still be there.
second:1030 text:So my personal suggestion is to use my one-click backup first
second:1034 text:which is also a script I wrote before
second:1036 text:Then he also has a matching video
second:1038 text:which you can refer to That video
second:1039 text:is actually very simple,
second:1040 text:and we directly execute this sentence in the terminal
second:1042 text:to complete the backup.
second:1043 text:After the backup, it is such a tar.
second:1046 text:GZ file, which can be restored with only one line of command
second:1049 text:in the future.
second:1050 text:So to sum up
second:1052 text:this step is that we perform a backup first
second:1055 text:and after the backup
second:1058 text:you can brush some of my new firmware
second:1060 text:We&#39;ll restore it after we finish it, so we can make sure it&#39;s safe
second:1062 text:All right, that&#39;s all I can say so far.
second:1064 text:In today&#39;s video, we explain how
second:1066 text:to build custom firmware quickly,
second:1069 text:how to download firmware,
second:1070 text:and how to do it.How to expand the capacity of firmware in two ways,
second:1073 text:and the final backup idea
second:1075 text:At present, there are many kinds of OpenWrt firmware,
second:1078 text:which can be said to be in full bloom.
second:1079 text:So you can also download different firmware according
second:1081 text:to your own needs
second:1083 text:and try it yourself.
second:1084 text:All right, that&#39;s all for today&#39;s video.
second:1087 text:See you in the next video.
